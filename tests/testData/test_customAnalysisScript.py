"""
NOTE: this is a modified version of the customAnalysis template designed to
be used for automated testing purposes. The `compute` method will simply return
the mean signal with the mask on every volume.

Template for creating customized analyses in Pyneal.

This tool allows users to design and implement unique analysis routines for
use during a real-time fMRI scan

The custom analysis routines are contained in a single class (called
CustomAnalysis). There are 2 important components to this class: the
'__init__' method and the 'compute' method.

The '__init__' method should contain all of the code you want executed BEFORE
the start of the real-time run. This could include setting up any necessary
paths, or loading any additional files (e.g. libraries, ROIs, trained
classifiers, etc). In addition, the class also provides a reference to the
mask_img that is specified from the Pyneal Setup GUI. Users can choose to use
this mask, or ignore completely.

The 'compute' method, on the other hand, should contain all of the code you
want executed on EACH NEW VOLUME as the scan is progression. The compute
method, in other words, is what actually gets called and executed during the
scan. The only stipulation is that the output gets returned as a dictionary
called 'result' at the end of each compute call. The 'result' dictionary can
contain as many key:value pairs as needed. The entire dictionary will get
passed along to the results server, where it will be tagged with a key
indicating which volIdx the results pertain to.

The CustomAnalysis template below has some specific variables pre-set that will
ensure that the class can integrate into the rest of the Pyneal workflow.
Please make sure to contain all of your edits within the sections labeled
"USER-SPECIFIED CODE"
