# Pyneal -- real-time fMRI Analysis Software

**Pyneal** is an open source software package to support real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It is entirely Python-based and depends exclusively on free, open source neuroimaging libraries.

It allows users to:

- access functional MRI data in real-time
- compute on-going analyses throughout a scan
- monitor data quality
- share analysis results with remote devices (e.g. send results to an experimental task presenting neurofeedback to participants)

![](src/images/overview.png)

It currently supports data formats used across 3 major MRI manufacturers: **GE**, **Siemens**, **Philips**.

In addition to allowing users to compute basic, ROI-based analyses during a scan, **Pyneal** also provides a simple framework for designing and writing customized analyses that can be computed across the whole brain volume at each timepoint.

## Documentation

Please see [**Pyneal Docs**](https://jeffmacinnes.github.io/pyneal-docs/) for full documentation of this package, including:

- Overview
- Installation/Setup
- Usage
- Customizing analyses
- Simulating fMRI environments for testing
- Troubleshooting
